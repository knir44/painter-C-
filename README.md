# painter-C#

## Introduction

Painter is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that seamlessly blends the principles of object-oriented programming, showcasing a robust implementation of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
This painting application serves for digital art creation, offering a feature-rich and visually intuitive experience.

#### Features:
Object-Oriented Foundation: Painter-CSharp leverages the power of C# to embody object-oriented programming principles, ensuring a well-structured and extensible codebase.

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism:
The application employs classes and inheritance to create a hierarchy of objects, allowing for code reuse and the flexibility to extend functionality through polymorphism.

#### Windows Forms Interface:
With a graphical interface built using Windows Forms, users can intuitively access a variety of drawing tools, making the digital art creation process both enjoyable and efficient.

#### File Handling:
Save and load functionalities are seamlessly integrated, enabling users to store and revisit their artistic creations effortlessly.

## Structure
The main class is Shape, My_pen, Line, and From_cage is inherited by Shape
Circle and Rectangle is inherited by From_cage/
Mission_unit and ShapeList are independent classes.


## Key Learnings
By developing this project, i have gained experience in the following areas:

#### Class Hierarchy and Inheritance:
Clear class hierarchy and inheritance relationships provide a structured codebase, enhancing code reuse and maintainability.

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design:
Developed proficiency in creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces using Windows Forms.

#### Event-Driven Programming:
Learned the principles of event-driven programming, where user actions or system events trigger specific responses within the application.

#### Code Organization:
The organization of classes into a logical hierarchy and the use of inheritance contribute to a well-structured codebase.
